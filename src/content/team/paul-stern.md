Throughout the years my business career has been multifaceted, from manufacturing and selling fashion merchandise, to operating a big box retail store as a Pharmacist, to owning and operating a clothing store and a restaurant. I began my career in real estate through personally investing and managing a broad portfolio of properties. I enjoy helping my Brokers understand their clients business and needs whether they are increasing the size of their business or downsizing. My business background of ownership and negotiations puts me in a unique position of being able to assist the start-up and the seasoned entrepreneur in leasing office space, retail space, and buying investment property. I enjoy what I do everyday, the industry never fails to fascinate me
